ðŸŽµ TikTok Audio Converter

One bus ride. One perfect TikTok cover. One saturday project.

While heading home, I came across a beautiful cover of one of my favorite songs on TikTokâ€”and all I wanted was to save that audio and loop it forever. Iâ€™m sure there are tools out there already, but I figured: why not build my own solution and learn C# along the way?

Thus, TikTokAudioConverter was bornâ€”a command-line tool that: 
Accepts a TikTok video link, Downloads the video, Converts it to audio (.wav), Embeds metadata (title, uploader, original TikTok URL)
and Saves the result to your local library

Itâ€™s a personal, nerdy way to collect your favorite TikTok sounds.
