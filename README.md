üéµ TikTok Audio Converter

>One bus ride. One perfect TikTok cover. One Saturday project.

While heading home, I came across a beautiful cover of one of my favorite songs on TikTok‚Äîand all I wanted was to save that audio and loop it forever. I‚Äôm sure there are tools out there already, but I figured: why not build my own solution and learn C# along the way?

This is a command-line tool that:
	‚Ä¢	Accepts a TikTok video link
	‚Ä¢	Downloads the video
	‚Ä¢	Converts it to audio (.wav)
	‚Ä¢	Embeds metadata (title, uploader, original TikTok URL)
	‚Ä¢	Saves the result to your local library

It‚Äôs a personal, nerdy way to collect your favorite TikTok sounds.


‚öôÔ∏è How to Use
	1.	Clone the project

git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/TikTokAudioConverter.git
cd TikTokAudioConverter.CLI



2. Build the project using:
dotnet build


3.	Run the CLI
dotnet run


4.	Paste any TikTok link when prompted.
   
5.	The tool will:
	‚Ä¢	Download the video
	‚Ä¢	Convert it to .wav audio
	‚Ä¢	Add metadata
	‚Ä¢	Save the file to VideoAudioLibrary/Audio/
	
6.	Type quit to exit.

üîú Future Plans ( maybe? maybe not )
	‚Ä¢	WPF GUI version
	‚Ä¢	Support for .mp3 and other outputs
	‚Ä¢	Add album art from video frames
	‚Ä¢	Batch conversion from a list of TikTok links

Built for fun. Learned a ton. Hope you enjoy using it ‚ú®
